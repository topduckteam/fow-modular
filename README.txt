There may be bugs in this. I don't think there are, but I'm not naive enough to assume there aren't. Let me know if you come across any (you can find my Facebook account via the Force of Will TCG US or Force of Will TCG ENG Facebook groups).

Cards you and your opponent play are rendered on your view based on your carddata.txt/images files. If something is going awry with rendering, I would first check the carddata and/or image files for the player experiencing the issues. That said, Lackey can be pretty unruly, so it’s possible it is the software. Try having the other player autoupdate using the same URL you did (this all goes for people trying to view games as well).

This update will remove all of your Valhalla cards, however they will certainly be in a [near] future update.
It’s possible I’ll also add support for Tokens in a [hopefully near] future update, however for now you’re going to have to go the peasant route and put random copies of an elf or something in your sideboard to use.

This update (along with any update I have released and may release) is done as a community service and is not for sale. It's free.
Similarly, all rights relating to Force of Will cards/images/intellectual property are retained solely by Force of Will Co. I am making no claim to them whatsoever; I am simply trying to utilize public resources to offer a free service for the good of the community. I am not responsible for any bugs or problems of any sort relating to or following the implementation of this 'update,' and I am not in any way affiliated with Lackey or Force of Will Co.

In any event, enjoy!
